# My Restaurant Page

Welcome to my Restaurant Page project! This single-page application (SPA) showcases a dynamic, interactive menu and information about a fictional restaurant. It's built using pure Vanilla JS, demonstrating skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and modular JavaScript, all bundled together with Webpack.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling, including custom animations and responsive design.
- **Vanilla JS (ES6+)**: Creating dynamic content and managing user interactions without third-party libraries or frameworks.
- **Webpack**: Module bundling, asset optimization, and development workflow enhancement.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Different sections of the restaurant page (e.g., Home, Menu, Contact) are loaded dynamically into the single page without a full page reload.
- **Interactive Menu**: Users can browse menu items, with detailed descriptions and pricing, organized in a visually appealing layout.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and provides an excellent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Contact Form**: A simple contact form allows users to send messages or inquiries, showcasing form handling in Vanilla JS.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Initially struggled with managing the SPA aspect without frameworks. **Solution**: Leveraged Webpack for module bundling and Vanilla JS skills for DOM manipulation, achieving seamless content switching.

## Lessons Learned

- Deepened my understanding of ES6+ features, especially template literals and fetch API for dynamic content generation.
- Gained practical experience in configuring and optimizing Webpack for a front-end project.
- Enhanced my skills in responsive web design, focusing on mobile-first principles.

## Setup and Installation
